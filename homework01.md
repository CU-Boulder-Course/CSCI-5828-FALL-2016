<h3>Q1 - Essential Difficulties </h3>
<p align="justify">
Essential difficulties are those inherent of the intricate nature of software engineering. Brooks says, which I quote \[[1](#ref1)\]

>"no inventions that will do for software productivity, reliability, and simplicity what electronics, transistors, and large-scale integration did for computer hardware."
